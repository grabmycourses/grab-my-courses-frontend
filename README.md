# Grab My Courses Reactjs Frontend (https://grabmycourses.com/)

## Grab My Courses is a utility that has been created to help students get the courses they are looking for in their school. 

### Lots of schools have limited courses and each course also limited seats itself. This leaves many students ending up taking courses they are not really intyersted in.
### The major features offered by this utility are:
### 	1. It notifies students when there is an open seat in the course of their interest.
### 	2. It provides a platform to help students swap/exchange their courses with fellow classmates.

### Currently this utility is publically available for Arizona State University alone but I am working to add more schools gradually.

### Following are some of the demo images for the public code presented as part of this repo:
